## local-library-project
This is a project is worked on while I attended Thinkful's Software Engineering Bootcamp. During my time working on this project, I was able to reinforce what I learned about how to write arrow functions and how to use the various array methods.

For this project, I built a number of different algorithims to help complete an administrative site for a local library. All of the functions worked on three common datasets. Building the algorithims for the administrative site would allow for the following features to be made: 
* Show which books are available and unavailable
* Show the most popular genres of books
* Show the most popular authors
* Show the most popular book titles
* Show user account information
* Show general stats

## "Stats By Account" Page
The "Stats by Account" page shows a list of borrowers' names. When you click on a name, certain admin information on that user will appear as well as books they currently have in possession, if any. If they do not have books in possession, it will say "No books currently taken out...".
