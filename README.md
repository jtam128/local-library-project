## local-library-project
This is a project is worked on while I attended Thinkful's Software Engineering Bootcamp. During my time working on this project, I was able to reinforce what I learned about how to write arrow functions and how to use the various array methods.

For this project, I built a number of different algorithims to help complete an administrative site for a local library. All of the functions worked on three common datasets. Building the algorithims for the administrative site would allow for the following features to be made: 
* Show which books are available and unavailable
* Show the most popular genres of books
* Show the most popular authors
* Show the most popular book titles
* Show user account information
* Show general stats
